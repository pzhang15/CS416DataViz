                        <h1>What Is the Yield Curve?</h1>
                        
                        <p>In finance, the yield curve is a graph which depicts how the yields on debt instruments - such as bonds - 
                            vary as a function of their years remaining to maturity.
                            Typically, the graph's horizontal or x-axis is a time line of months or years remaining to maturity, 
                            with the shortest maturity on the left and progressively longer time periods on the right. 
                            The vertical or y-axis depicts the annualized yield to maturity.
                            <b>One measure of slope, the spread between 10-year Treasury bonds and 2-Year Treasury bills, bears out this relation.</b>
                        </p>
                        <h1>Why is it important?</h1>

                            The slope of the yield curve—the difference between the yields on short- 
                            and long-term maturity bonds—has achieved some notoriety as a simple forecaster 
                            of economic growth. 
                        </p>

                            <b>More generally, a flat curve indicates weak growth and, conversely, a steep curve indicates strong growth. 
                                Inverted yield curve (short rates above long rates) indicates a recession in about a year, and yield curve inversions have preceded each of the last eight recessions

                                On Friday, April 14, 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index fell 9%, ending a week in which it fell 25%. 
                                Investors were forced to sell stocks ahead of Tax Day, the due date to pay taxes on gains realized in the previous year.
                                By June 2000, dot-com companies were forced to reevaluate their spending on advertising campaigns.
                                On November 9, 2000, Pets.com, a much-hyped company that had backing from Amazon.com, went out of business only nine months after completing its IPO.
                                By that time, most Internet stocks had declined in value by 75% from their highs, wiping out <b>$1.755 trillion</b> in value.

                                Prior to the crisis, financial institutions became highly leveraged, increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses. 
                                Much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as off-balance sheet securitization and derivatives.
                                Free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from <b>$627 billion in 2001 to $1,428 billion in 2005</b> as the housing bubble built.

                                From its peak in the second quarter of 2007 at $61.4 trillion, household wealth in the United States fell <b>$11 trillion</b>, to $59.4 trillion by the end of the first quarter of 2009, 
                                resulting in a decline in consumption, then a decline in business investment.In the fourth quarter of 2008, <b>the quarter-over-quarter decline in real GDP in the U.S. was 8.4%.</b>
                                The U.S. unemployment rate peaked at 11.0% in October 2009, the highest rate since 1983 and roughly twice the pre-crisis rate.
